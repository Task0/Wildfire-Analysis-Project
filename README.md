# Wildfire Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical wildfire data sourced from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System. The goal is to gain insights into fire incidents, their distribution, and trends over the years through data analysis and interactive visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical wildfire data for different years, including attributes such as latitude, longitude, brightness, confidence, and more. The data is organized by year and country.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   - Download historical wildfire data from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System.
   - Organize and load the data using Python and Pandas.
   - Preprocess the data to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of fire incidents and key attributes over the years.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create interactive global maps using latitude and longitude coordinates to visualize fire incidents.
   - Implement filters to allow users to explore fire incidents by year or date range.
   - Display additional information about specific incidents on user interaction.

4. **Reporting and Insights:**
   - Summarize findings from the exploratory analysis and visualization.
   - Discuss trends, patterns, and insights derived from the data.
   - Highlight regions with high fire frequencies and any significant observations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python environment with required libraries (specified in requirements.txt).
3. Organize the downloaded historical wildfire data in a suitable directory structure.
4. Run the Python scripts provided to preprocess and analyze the data.
5. Explore the interactive visualizations generated using the Python scripts.
